title: Me, My Mistakes & I: My First Pass at Data Science
---

I left my job a few months ago in search of a more creative career path; and I ended up here, at Metis in Chicago, studying Data Science. Fingers crossed!

On the first day, we were assigned a project, to be presented in one week. Our “client,” WomenTech WomenYes asked for insight on where to deploy their street team at New York City subway stations to best advertise their upcoming gala. They hoped to reach as many people as possible, but they also hoped to target the right people– those passionate about increasing female representation in tech. 

My team and I worked our way through a few public data sets, MTA Turnstile, US Census, and NYC Open data to analyze foot traffic, city demographic information, and local university locations.
