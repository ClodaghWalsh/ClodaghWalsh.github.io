# Me, My Mistakes & I: 
## My First Try at Data Science

I left my job a few months ago in search of a more creative career path; and I ended up
here, at Metis in Chicago, studying Data Science. Fingers crossed!

On the first day, we were assigned a project, to be presented in one week. Our “client,”
WomenTech WomenYes asked for insight on where to deploy their street team at New York
City subway stations to best advertise their upcoming gala. They hoped to reach as many
people as possible, but they also hoped to target the right people– those passionate
about increasing female representation in tech. 

My team and I worked our way through a few public data sets, MTA Turnstile, US Census,
and NYC Open data to analyze foot traffic, city demographic information, and local
university locations.

Already, I have been introduced to many topics and tools I hadn’t encountered in my self-guided study. Perhaps the most important lessons I learned are less technical, however. 


### Data is everywhere!

Most of the data-related work I had done up to this point had been assigned to me in school. I was given a dataset and had to answer some defined
question. Now, I am starting to ask my own questions and realizing just how much data available to us all. That being said, 


### Data is MESSY.

Before Metis, I had mostly used national survey data that was pretty clean, well-defined, and easy to use. I expected the MTA data to be similar.
However, some of the entries would inexplicably turn negative, and a few recorded over 1 million entries per day. Did the negative counts reflect
accurate traffic in their magnitude, or were they errors? What caused a turnstile to report such large numbers, that they had to be errors? Were there
other errors like this that we were missing just because the entry values seemed “reasonable?”

I switched to Data Science because I believe that we can utilize data to improve our decision-making and better evaluate our imperfect systems. But when
the questions become more heavy, and the consequence of getting the “wrong” answer isn’t a low turn out for a gala, but an overly lengthy prison
sentence, finding “good” data is even more important. 


### Done is better than perfect. 

Okay so somebody famous figured that one out first, but still!

It’s fun to spend time dreaming up interesting ways to approach a problem, but at some point, we must choose a path and execute the plan. I found this
quote in a brainstorming guide provided to us by Metis:

“Don't over-design and under-deliver. For every data science project that you see or hear about, the version in the data scientist's head was probably
fancier, bigger, more comprehensive, more elegant, presented in a cooler format, or with better copy, et cetera, ad nauseum. The reason you heard about
it at all, however, is because it was finished, and published or released in all its heart-wrenching imperfection.”

I think I will need to remind myself of this a few times over the next 12 weeks.

From now on in the program, we ask our own questions and find our own data. I’m going to make so many new mistakes! Then, I’ll figure it out with the
help of my instructors and classmates. Most likely, I’ll come out of this realizing that the world is even more complex and messy than I had imagined.
But then we have lots of work to do, don’t we?
